Documentation for this wrapper can be found here: 

https://api-docs2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_welcome.html

I have also included a sample script to help get started. 

To get started with you will need to clone the repo first. 

git clone https://github.com/briandav22/ScrutinizerPythonAPI.git

once instead this directory. install the requirments. 

pip install -r requirments.txt 

You can now build your own script following the documentation, of you can modify the api_call_example.py script with your Scrutinizer hostname and Authtoken as a way to get started quickly.
